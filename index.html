        <p>
            My name is Ian Parks, I am currently a junior at the University of Maryland, 
            College Park. I am studying Computer Science with a specialization in 
            Cybersecurity and a minor in Chinese Language as well as a minor in Advanced 
            Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) in the Honors college. I plan 
            on raising my Chinese minor to a secondary degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a recipient of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Scholarship for 
            Service (SFS). I have received academic honors for at least three semesters. 
            If you are interested in seeing the classes I’ve taken or the ones I am taking 
            now, please look at my 
            <a href="resources/Parks_Ian_2019-8-27_Unofficial_Transcript.pdf">transcript</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been programming since I was 11 years old and have learned C, Java, 
            Python, JavaScript, and more. I have written many programs in Java, ranging 
            from simple to complex, personal projects to production grade. I'm used to 
            writing automated tests, including using Selenium to test web scrapers. I’ve 
            worked with Spring for well over a year and I am familiar with connecting 
            Java code to a Mongo database. I helped work on and develop front end 
            applications including a website designed in React as well as a mobile app 
            designed in React Native. I spent three months working on full stack 
            development and am confident in maintaining such a project.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I learned about and implemented security features like JWT 
            tokens and using Spring Security to secure our resource’s endpoints. I am 
            currently in the ACES program here at the University of Maryland learning 
            more about digital forensics, computer systems, and more cybersecurity-related 
            topics. I hope to apply this knowledge in the near future.
        </p>
