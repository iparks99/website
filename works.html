				<h1>Some Projects I've Made</h1>

				<h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
				<p>
					I spent 3 months learning and working on a project from end-to-end.
					I made the backend in Java, with a Mongo database, using Spring framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					The frontend is made in JavaScript, using React Native for the mobile app.
					We used React for the website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both the mobile app and the website queried the database securely, and 
					required tokens or a new login to access secure resources.
				</p>

				<h2>Spring Security & JWT</h2>
				<p>
					I added security to our project using Spring Security to create JWT access 
					tokens for the user, as well as implementing JWT refresh tokens for a more 
					user-friendly experience. I learned about OAuth and how to create a secure 
					service for the user.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Video Game Animation Project</h2>
				<p>
						The following slideshow displays a project I made in my senior year of high school, in the spring of 2017. I made this project in Java to test my abilities to use graphics and perform animations. This was my most ambitious project, but I hope to create even more impressive ones in the near future. Visit the <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page to check it out!

				<h2>Projects from Freshman Year</h2>
				<p>
						In my freshman year of college, I made many projects for my object-oriented programming classes (No pun intended). I learned about ADT's and made projects related to Maps, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, PriorityQueues, BinarySearchTrees, and Graphs. In addition, I learned about multi-threading and sorting algorithms. I learned about algorithmic complexity and how to find it for algorithms. Lastly, I learned TeX for beautifully formatted documents.
				</p>

				<h2>Projects from Sophomore Year</h2>
				<p>
					In my sophomore year of college, I learned about the importance of memory management with C, as well as basic low-level MIPS Assembly programming.
					I learned OCaml, Ruby, Python, and Rust. We created our own basic compilers in class.
				</p>

				<h2>Work With Interclypse</h2>
				<p>
					From May 2018 to August 2019, I worked with Interclypse and Sofiac to write
					software predominantly in Java. We use Git, Maven, MongoDB, Spring,
					and Docker to build this project. In addition, I used React, React-Native, Expo,
					and Spring Security to create secure full-stack projects and mobile apps.
				</p>

				<h2>Work With the FDA</h2>
				<p>
						I spent 6 months as a contracted intern with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration working with a team researching noroviruses. I developed software for them to deal with large amounts of data and to extract information from third-party software. I have an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437133/">acknowledgement</a> in the paper the team worked on for my help.
				</p>

				<h2>Top-Down Block Shooter</h2>
				<p>
						This was a quick little game I made to test my capabilities in Java with graphics and math. It is a fun game, and try to see how far you can get!

				<h2>Breakout-Style Game</h2>
				<p>
						I made this game as a project for my Fall 2017 Computer Science class. It is written in Processing, which is similar to Java and took me less than an hour for the core functionality and a little bit more for the rest of the features.
				</p>

				<h2>This Website!</h2>
				<p>
						On top of my classes, extracurriculars, family and social life, I made all these projects and this website in my free time. I am committed to learning new skills and I hope to apply them in the real world everyday.
